### Persistent Workflow State

The AI workflow screens (`HakiDraft`, `HakiLens`, `HakiReview`) now use a shared process store to preserve progress across navigation. Access state with the helpers exported from `src/contexts/ProcessContext.tsx`:

- `getProcessState(processKey)` – read the latest state slice
- `updateProcessState(processKey, updater)` – merge or replace state
- `resetProcessState(processKey?)` – reset a slice (or all slices when omitted)

Any new workflow should leverage `useProcess()` instead of local `useState` hooks so users never lose progress when switching tabs or routes.
